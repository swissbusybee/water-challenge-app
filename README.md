# Get Started with WaterCount

WaterCount is a water usage calculator that shows how much water is consumed with a visual reference. It is easy enough for a child to use and should help all to understand how much water they consume and remind them how they can conserve water.

## Set up Steps

2. Follow the instructions to link to the repo in order to contribute
3. Start developing and follow the below command to run the add in the development mode. 

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

4. Only run the below when we are ready to build the app for production.

### `npm build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Your app is ready to be deployed!
